# Weather Application <br/>
# Overview <br/>
 This is a full-stack weather application built using React, MUI, and Node.js with a MongoDB database. The application allows users to log in, view their favorite cities, and check the current weather for each city. User login persists between sessions, and favorite cities are stored and retrieved from a MongoDB database.
